The gem resonates with the chosen material, and this movement is amplified by the wooden rod, allowing to detect nearby Otherworld materials.$(br2) The rod works by detecting resonance between real world and Otherworld materials.

Only horizontal distance is considered, so the crystal will glow fully purple, even if many blocks above or below the target. The range of the divination rod is 96 blocks. The closest the rod can detect is 6 blocks, at that point the crystal glows fully purple, and getting closer will not change the color any further."

To find them, attune your divination rod to Otherworld leaves or logs, as unlike Otherstone, they only spawn in these groves."

Trees grown from Stable Otherworld Saplings as obtained from spirit traders do not have that limitation."
